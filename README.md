Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning ðŸ“ˆ

Predict future stock prices using historical market data with machine learning models such as LSTM and Linear Regression. This project demonstrates time-series forecasting, data preprocessing, and visualization of actual vs predicted prices.

##ðŸ”¹ Features

Predicts stock price trends using historical stock data.

Preprocesses data with scaling, missing value handling, and train-test splitting.

Supports LSTM-based time-series forecasting.

Provides interactive visualization of actual vs predicted prices.

Includes a saved model for easy reuse without retraining.

ðŸ”¹ Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository_url>


Install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

ðŸ”¹ Usage

Load the dataset or specify a stock symbol.

Preprocess the data:

python preprocess_data.py


Train the model or load a pre-trained model:

from keras.models import load_model
model = load_model("lstm_stock_model.h5")


Predict future prices and visualize results:

python predict.py

ðŸ”¹ Results

Accurate prediction of stock prices using LSTM.

Visualization of predicted vs actual stock prices.

Model performance evaluated using RMSE, MSE, and MAE.

ðŸ”¹ Future Work

Add sentiment analysis from financial news to improve predictions.

Experiment with GRU or Transformer models for better accuracy.

Implement real-time stock price prediction with live data.

ðŸ”¹ Dataset

Historical stock data from Yahoo Finance (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).
